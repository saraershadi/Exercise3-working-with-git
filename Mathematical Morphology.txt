Summary:
      In this project, we intend to separate musical notes from guide lines by using morphological operations and their application.
     As you may know, in writing music in the western way, notes are oval-like shapes that are placed between 5 lines, which are called the five carrier lines, and can be recognized based on their position in relation to these lines. What is the desired note?
     A field called Optical Music Recognition, or OMR for short, tries to use computer vision to analyze the image of a given sheet of music and find its musical information.
     Given the complexity and the sheer number of symbols on a sheet of music, this can be quite difficult, but as a first step, you can start by separating the notes from the lines.
     The goal is to use morphological operations to identify the notes in a piece of music and draw a line around them.
